# Data Structure & Algorithm Practice

### Introduction

This repository is a collection of my notes as a "proof of understanding" I created to log my journey as I learn
Data Structures & Algorithms.

I've broken the repo into two directories, one for data structures and one for algorithms.
Each file in those directories is heavily commented with my original learnings & thoughts about the relevant concept.
The two sections immediately below this one represent concepts I either have included or want to include in the repository.

### Data Structures

- [Arrays](https://github.com/FritzTheDev/DSA/blob/main/data-structures/Arrays.md/)
- Singly-Linked Lists
- Doubly-Linked Lists
- Stacks
- Queues
- Binary Trees
- Binary Search Trees

### Algorithms
